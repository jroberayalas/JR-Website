The following are a series of notes from the great book [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)
  by [Richard McElreath](http://xcelab.net/rm/), which comes accompanied by the R
  package [`rethinking`](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) and some [improvements](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse)
  (thanks to [Solomon Kurz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Solomon_Kurz)) from
  [Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/about/)’s [`brms`](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms)
  package, [Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)'s [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)
  package and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) syntax. These are mainly
  done for my future self, to help me remember the main concepts and ideas.
