abstract = "Future wireless networks are expected to handle a huge number of devices, including sensors, within a low energy consumption. In this scope, we present, in this paper, performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN). Specifically, we aim at finding the optimal transmit power of a node communicating with multiple receivers in a cognitive radio (CR) spectrum sharing framework, i.e., existence of an active primary user. We first present the optimal power with single secondary receiver, under instantaneous or average transmission rate constraints. Then, we propose a suboptimal solution for an easier, yet efficient, implementation and perform insightful asymptotical analysis for both schemes with Rayleigh fading. Afterwards, we extend our results to a multiple secondary receives CR scenario and present the corresponding optimal and suboptimal transmit power while satisfying independent peak/average and sum of peak/average transmission rate constraints. The corresponding numerical results are provided for Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. We characterize some transmission outage events depending on system parameters."
